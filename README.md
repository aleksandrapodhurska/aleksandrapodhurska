- 👋 Hi, I am a full stack developer with a strong desire to gain the highest proficiency in JS and frameworks. Being a fearless self-starter, meeting challenges on my way I never give up and go on running my game.
- 🌱 Currently I have been working on gaining vast experience in Vue+Laravel, PHP and keep challenging myself in that.
- 🫡 In December 2021 I finished my intensive course in John Bryce and dived headfirst into a new occupation.
- 🫶🏻 I have been away from GitHub for a while since that, but now, when I feel much more confident in my daily developer duties I am happy to get back to my own projects!

- 📫 You can reach me on a.podhurska@gmail.com or on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandra-podhurska/
