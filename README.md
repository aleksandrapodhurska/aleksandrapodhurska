- 👋 Hi, I’m @aleksandrapodhurska. I am a full stack development student with a strong desire to gain high proficiency in development.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning languages and reading. For now I speak English and Hebrew fluently, while Russian is my mother tongue.
- 🌱 So currently I'm working on deeper undestanding in JavaScript and challenging myself in React. Untill June 2021 I learnt all the JavaScript and React concepts by myself
      until I desided to get expert mentorship in my code school.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that would help me to get more experience 'on the field' and communicate with great people that I could learn from.
- 📫 You can reach me on a.podhurska@gmail.com or on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandra-podhurska/
