- 👋 Hi, I’m @aleksandrapodhurska. I am a student full stack developer with a strong desire to gain high proficiency in JS and frameworks.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning languages and reading. As of today I can speak English and Hebrew fluently, while my mother tongue is Russian.
- 🌱 Currently I've been working to maintain deeper undestanding in JavaScript and challenging myself in it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that would help me to get more experience 'at the field' and communicate with great people that I could learn from.
- 📫 You can reach me on a.podhurska@gmail.com or on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandra-podhurska/
