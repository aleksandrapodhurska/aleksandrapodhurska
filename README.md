ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I am a full stack developer with a strong desire to gain the highest proficiency in JS and frameworks. Being a fearless self-starter, meeting challenges on my way I never give up and go on running my game.
ğŸŒ± Currently I have been working on gaining vast experience in Vue+Laravel, PHP and keep challenging myself in that.
